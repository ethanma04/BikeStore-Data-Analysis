# BikeStore-Data-Analysis
 
This data analysis project consists of managing and organizing sales data from a simulated bike store. Using **SQL** the data is queried and later visualized in the form of an executive dashboard.
The dataset is provided by the YouTube channel _Work the Data_ in the Full Data Analysis Exercise.

In this project, there are two different variations for the data visualization:

The first being in **Excel** where pivot tables and slicers are utilized to create various interactive graphs which when finalized are sent to management for review. 
The second dashboard utilizes **Tableau** which contains the same information as the Excel dashboard but formatted on the dashboard differently.

The graphs created for this dashboard consists of the following information:
- Total Revenue
- Revenue / Month
- Revenue / State
- Revenue / Store
- Revenue / Brand
- Revenue / Product Category
- Top 10 Customers
- Revenue / Sales Rep
- Filters for order_date, state, and store_name categories
